# About Me

![Martina Guillermo](pictures/IMG_6042_1.JPG)

I am a Data Manager and Research Analyst with extensive experience in epidemiological research and data analysis. Currently, I work at **InnovaLab - Health Innovation Lab** at Cayetano Heredia University, where I conduct epidemiological analyses to explore the relationship between infectious diseases and various sociodemographic, climatic, and environmental factors. Additionally, I serve as a **Data Manager** for the **PISACC** study, funded by the **National Institutes of Health (NIH)**, and the **IMPACT Salud** study, funded by the **National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR), UK**. My expertise includes statistical modeling, spatial data analysis, and the implementation of research tools like REDCap and Power BI. I am passionate about applying data-driven approaches to tackle complex public health challenges, especially in the field of infectious diseases.
